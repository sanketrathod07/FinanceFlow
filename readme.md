# FinanceFlow - Dynamic Dashboard with Authentication and API Integration

## Overview
FinanceFlow is a fully functional, dynamic dashboard designed to provide a seamless experience for managing financial data. It includes authentication, API data fetching, filtering, and a responsive UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
### 1. Authentication
- Users can log in using their email and password.
- Implements form validation:
  - Email format verification.
  - Password must be at least 6 characters.
- Stores a mock JWT token in **localStorage** upon successful login.
- Logout clears the token and redirects the user to the login page.
- Protects the dashboard route by redirecting unauthorized users to the login page.

### 2. Dashboard Page
- **Layout:**
  - Header displaying user info and logout button.
  - Sidebar navigation with links to Dashboard, Settings, and Profile.
  - Main content area displaying API data in a table format.
- **API Data Handling:**
  - Fetches posts from **JSONPlaceholder API** (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`).
  - Implements search and filtering functionality (by title or ID).
  - Supports pagination (5 posts per page).
- **Error Handling:**
  - Displays an error message when the API call fails.

### 3. API Integration
- Uses `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` for initial server-side data fetching.
- Uses `useEffect` and `useState` hooks for client-side data updates, filtering, and pagination.
- Default data is preloaded to ensure a functional UI from the start.

### 4. Styling
- Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive design.
- Works smoothly on all screen sizes.
- Includes hover effects and transitions for a polished UI.
- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - Dark mode toggle.
  - Uses **Shadcn/ui** components (tables, buttons, inputs).
  - Loading spinners while fetching API data.
